# Note that most of the entries in this file have been added with "modules"
# in mind. For example, instead of specifying Gradle's build folder as
# /build/, it's added as build/, which implies such directory on
# any level, and not just root. That is because the root of this umbrella
# project is not the actual service, but an umbrella directory which
# combines all services. So care must be taken not to name a source
# directory something like "dist", "out", "target", "build" and so on.
# We could handle that accidental match situation by using /**/build/
# syntax, but I went for a less restrictive approach.
